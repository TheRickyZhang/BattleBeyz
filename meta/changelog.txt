2024-08-08 wmm On your first run attempt you might get a "freetype.dll not found".
               A quick fix is to copy the dll lib\freetype-2.13.2\dll\win64\freetype.dll to build\Debug.
               Eventually we will make this happen automatically.
 

               Started adding comments compatible with Doxygen.  I first learned this using Java, so
               I tend to use JavaDoc-compatible comments.  There's a nice summary of the commands
               in the JavaDoc wikipedia article

               Renamed CallbackData to GameControl.

               Added debugMode to GameControl.

               Restructured keyboard handling so it is all now handled in the keyboard event handler.
               This eliminates the need for processInput().  Also, CTRL-D toggles debug mode, which currently
               means show the bounding boxes as wireframes.

               Only call some of the renderDebug routines when debugMode is enabled.

               Modified the bounding box render to show wireframes instead of solids.

               Added a bodyPosition argument to BoundingBox::renderDebug.  This is required
               to properly translate the bounding boxes to the actual position of the owning
               body.  CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER CASES.

               Refactored Callback.cpp (alphabetized functions).

               Added a required parameter "name" to the RigidBody constructure.  This is helpful
               for debugging.

               Changed some types from unsigned int to the more explicity uint32_t.

               Added casts here and there, or changed loop variables to match size_t or to
               downcast a size_t to uint32_t.

               In Beyblade.cpp, made the map keys type uint32_t because size_t is overkill and wasteful.

               Clean up Camera::processKeyboard.

               Move #include "UI.h" to the top of main.cpp, and removed other redundant includes.
               This eleminates the "APIENTRY redefined" warning.

               Added #define _USE_MATH_DEFINES and #include <cmath> in Stadium.h so M_PI will be defined.

               <cmath> and <math.h> are a bit weird -- to get a definition of M_PI I put a preprocessor
               define of _USE_MATH_DEFINES in the project for each build variation.

               Some code being included fails unless you deine GLM_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL.  I also defined
               this in the project for each build variation.

2024-08-14     Added the above defines to CmakeLists.txt.

2024-08-20     The cameraPosStr contains newlines that are rendered as various kinds of junk depending on the font.
               If you want to handline newlines you have to do it yourself.  Also, the paladins font is horrible.  OpenSans-Regular 
               looks much better.

2024-09-08     Added doxygen-friendly comments to Buffers.cpp, Camera.cpp, Physics.cpp, Utils.cpp

               Fixed some casts in UI.cpp, Statdium.cpp, and RigidBodies/StadiumBody.cpp to avoid warnings.  Also
               fixed typos in a couple of comments.

               Note: UI.cpp could use some doxygen-friendly comment blocks, but not added today.

               Removed unused deltaTime parameter from Physics::preventStadiumClipping().

               RigidBody.h:  It is customary to define in order of constructors, destructors, and then members, so
               changed the order of some defintions.  No effect on code.  Also, the TODO comment says "Not needed anymore".  Really?
               Isn't the camera is a RigidBody.

               Buffers.h: Removed obsolete TODO comment.

               Stadium.h:  Removed TODO comment about "remove bounding boxes?".

               Camera.cpp:  Updated some comments.

               TextRender.cpp:  Updated TODO comment.
